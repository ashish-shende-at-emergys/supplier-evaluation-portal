Followed bottom-up approach [Model Design Development  to API + UI]

1. Setup coding policies

2. Prompt — Create Supplier Schema
	Create a supplier data model for evaluating suppliers based on capability, region, cost, and performance rating.

3. Prompt — Build Fit Logic
	Create a supplier fit scoring logic using:
	Capability match (40%)
	Cost alignment (30%)
	Region match (20%)
	Performance rating (10%)
	
4. Prompt - Cost Alignment Logic
	Add logic to evaluate cost alignment:
	If supplier cost ≤ target cost → High alignment
	If within 10% → Medium
	Else → Low
	
5. Prompt — Risk Logic
	Add a basic supplier risk indicator based on:
	Performance rating
	Region concentration
	
6. Prompt — Build Recommendation Engine
	Create logic that ranks suppliers based on fit score and outputs:
	Supplier Name
	Fit Score
	Risk Level
	Cost Alignment
	
7. Prompt  — API Layer
	Create a simple API endpoint that accepts:
	Component type
	Volume
	Region
	Target cost
	And returns ranked suppliers
	
8. Prompt — UI Table
	Generate a simple UI table layout to display ranked supplier recommendations.
